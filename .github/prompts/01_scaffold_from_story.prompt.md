Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and the selected story text.
Scaffold ONLY what is needed for that story.

After scaffolding, output:
- What files you created/modified (paths only)
- The commands to run to verify (install, test, typecheck)
- Any TODOs that belong to later stories (do not implement them now)

Story (selected text):
${selectedText}

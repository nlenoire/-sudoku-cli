You are implementing exactly ONE story from `BACKLOG_PACK.md` (the selected text below).

Rules:
- Follow `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Implement only what this story requires (no extra features)
- Prefer tests-first and deterministic tests
- Keep changes small and reviewable

Output:
1) A short plan mapped to Acceptance Criteria
2) List of files you will touch (paths)
3) Then implement the changes
4) Finally: verification commands and expected outcomes

Story (selected text):
